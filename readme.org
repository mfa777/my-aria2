* Overview

This project provides a simple, configurable Docker image for [[https://aria2.github.io/][aria2]], supporting persistent
config and session storage, and automatic publish to Docker Hub with =latest= and version tags.

* Features

- Easily configurable via host-mounted config file
- Download session persistence
- RPC support with secret
- Automatic Docker Hub publishing via GitHub Actions
- Both =latest= and versioned tags

* Getting Started

** 1. Clone This Repository**

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/mfa777/my-aria2.git
cd my-aria2
#+end_src

** 2. Set Up Configuration**

- Edit =config/aria2.conf= and change the rpc-secret password.
- Edit =docker-compose.yml= to set the download path on host.

** 3. Run Docker Compose**

#+begin_src shell
  sudo docker compose up -d
#+end_src

** 4. Connect via RPC

When using an RPC client (like **AriaNg**), connect to:

- ~http://<your_host_ip>:6800/jsonrpc~
- Use your `rpc-secret` as the token.

** Note

*** Support HTTP/HTTPS only

Do not support BitTorrent, I personally have no demand on it. I pefer use cloud service to convert torrent/magnetlink to HTTP(s) link then download with aria2.

* For Developer Only

** Publishing to Docker Hub Automatically

This project uses GitHub Actions to build and push Docker images to Docker Hub on every commit and tag.

*** Setup Steps:

1. Create a Docker Hub [[https://hub.docker.com/settings/security][access token]].
2. In your GitHub repository, go to =Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions=.
3. Add secrets:
   - =DOCKERHUB_USERNAME=: your Docker Hub username
   - =DOCKERHUB_TOKEN=: your access token

*** Tagging for Docker Hub Publish

- On every commit to =main=, GitHub Actions pushes:
  - =youruser/aria2:latest=
  - =youruser/aria2:<short-sha>=

- On every git tag (e.g. =v1.2.3=), it also pushes:
  - =youruser/aria2:v1.2.3=

*** To Release a Version:

#+begin_src shell
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
#+end_src

** Example: Pulling from Docker Hub

#+begin_src shell
docker pull youruser/aria2:latest
docker pull youruser/aria2:v1.0.0
#+end_src
